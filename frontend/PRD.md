**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Product Owner:** [Your Name/Team]

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the "Mood Journal" mobile application. The goal is to create a minimal and simple tool that allows users to track their daily mood and reflect on their emotional states through a straightforward interface. This PRD incorporates all clarifications provided to ensure a precise understanding of the product's scope and functionality.

### 2. Problem Statement

Many individuals seek a simple, non-intrusive method to monitor their emotional well-being without the complexity of traditional journaling apps. Existing solutions often include too many features, making the process cumbersome and discouraging consistent use. There is a need for a focused application that prioritizes ease of use and quick logging of emotional states.

### 3. Solution Overview

The Mood Journal will be a mobile application designed to provide a minimalist experience for daily mood tracking. Users will be able to select an overall mood for the day, add multiple emoji-only entries throughout the day to capture specific feelings, and view a chronological timeline of their past moods and entries. The application will focus on simplicity, speed, and a clear, read-only historical view.

### 4. Goals

*   To provide a minimal and intuitive interface for users to log their daily mood.
*   To enable quick, emoji-based journaling for specific moments throughout the day.
*   To offer a clear, chronological, and read-only view of past mood selections and entries.
*   To encourage consistent mood tracking through a simple and engaging user experience.

### 5. Target Audience

Individuals who:
*   Are looking for a simple and quick way to track their daily emotional state.
*   Prefer a minimalist interface over feature-rich journaling applications.
*   Want to reflect on their mood patterns over time without the ability to alter past records.

### 6. Key Features

#### 6.1. Daily Mood Selector
*   **Description:** Users will be presented with a clear interface to select their overall mood for the current day. This selection will typically be made once per day.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   A set of predefined mood options (e.g., happy, sad, neutral, anxious, excited) represented by distinct visual elements (e.g., colors, simple icons).
    *   The ability to change the daily mood selection for the current day until the day concludes.

#### 6.2. Emoji-based Entries
*   **Description:** Beyond the daily mood selection, users can add specific emotional markers throughout the day. These entries are designed to be quick, capturing momentary feelings.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Users can add **multiple entries** throughout a single day.
    *   Each entry consists **solely of a single emoji**, without any accompanying text field.
    *   Each emoji entry will be timestamped automatically upon creation.
    *   A clear interface for selecting from a standard set of emojis.

#### 6.3. Mood Timeline
*   **Description:** A dedicated section of the app will display a chronological history of all past daily mood selections and their associated emoji entries.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Presents a list view, ordered by date (most recent first).
    *   Each day's entry will show the selected daily mood and all emoji entries added for that day, along with their respective timestamps.
    *   **This timeline is a simple, view-only list.** Users **cannot edit or delete** past daily mood selections or individual emoji entries from this view.

### 7. User Stories

*   **7.1. Mood Selection**
    *   As a user, I want to easily select my overall mood for the current day, so I can quickly log my general emotional state.

*   **7.2. Emoji Entry**
    *   As a user, I want to add multiple entries throughout the day, with each entry consisting solely of a single emoji, so I can quickly capture and express specific feelings at different times.

*   **7.3. Timeline View**
    *   As a user, I want to view a simple, read-only chronological list of my past daily moods and associated emoji entries, so I can reflect on my emotional history without making changes.

### 8. Technical Requirements (High-Level)

*   **Platform:** Native mobile application (iOS and/or Android).
*   **Data Storage:** Local-first data storage for all mood selections and emoji entries, ensuring privacy and offline functionality.
*   **Data Structure:** Each daily record should include:
    *   Date
    *   Selected Daily Mood (e.g., enum or ID)
    *   A list of Emoji Entries, where each entry contains:
        *   Emoji character/code
        *   Timestamp
*   **User Interface:** Intuitive and responsive UI/UX design focused on minimalism and ease of use.

### 9. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** The application must be fast and responsive, with minimal loading times for all screens.
*   **Usability:** The interface should be highly intuitive, requiring minimal instruction for new users.
*   **Reliability:** The application must be stable, free from crashes, and consistently store user data.
*   **Security:** All user mood data will be stored locally on the device, ensuring privacy. No cloud synchronization or external data sharing is planned for V1.
*   **Accessibility:** Basic accessibility considerations for screen readers and larger text sizes.

### 10. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for V1)

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the initial release but may be considered for future iterations:

*   Cloud synchronization and backup of mood data.
*   Advanced mood analytics, trends, or reporting.
*   Customizable mood options or emoji sets.
*   Ability to edit or delete past entries (explicitly excluded for V1 based on clarification).
*   Reminders for daily logging.
*   Integration with other health platforms.
